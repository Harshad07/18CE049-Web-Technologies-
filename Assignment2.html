       The 7 Chakras are the energy centers in our body in which energy flows through...a Chakra is like a whirling, vortex-like, powerhouse of energy. 
	   Within our bodies, you have seven of these major energy centers and many more minor ones. You can think of Chakras as invisible, rechargeable batteries. 
	   They are charged and recharged through contact with the stream of cosmic energy in the atmosphere in much the same way that your home is connected to a 
	   central power source within a city-the only difference is that this cosmic energy source is free...The seven major Chakras are in the center of the body...
